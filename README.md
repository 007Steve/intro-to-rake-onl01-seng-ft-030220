# intro-to-rake


There are some tasks that need to be done every now and then. In the bad old days we used to write scrips with BASH. BASH is a terrible language and is just not as powerful as Ruby. We wanted the ability to do modules, and mostly to express ourself in ruby. This is a common pattern for most languages. The C community was the first to discover how nice it would be to be able to write their recurring system maintenance tasks in a separate file. They called this file the MakeFile becuase it was used generally to gather all of the source files and make it into one compiled executable. In Ruby we have Rake. 

Then show the mechanics of rake and how to add tasks. Also make sure to point out rake -T
